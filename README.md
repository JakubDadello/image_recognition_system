# image_recognition_system

Image Recognition System is an image classification project based on a residual convolutional neural network (ResNet) with a custom implementation of residual layers and transfer learning. The goal is to recognize objects from the Caltech-101 dataset (101 classes).

The model, defined in model.py, was trained for 5 epochs, monitoring loss and accuracy on both training and validation sets.

The project includes image preprocessing, data augmentation, and techniques to improve model generalization.

The results demonstrate effective classification and stable convergence, enhanced by transfer learning.

Technologies and tools: Python, TensorFlow/Keras, NumPy, Matplotlib, Pandas.
